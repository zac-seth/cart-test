# Recap

What went well?

What were the snags/gotchas?

What would you improve given/more time resources?

If you used a framework, why did you? And what would you have done differently if you hadn't?

Do you have any feedback on the challenge (what would you change, improve, keepâ€¦)?

NOTES:

* I spent a lot of time setting up the build configuration after making changes to the webpack configuration. This was because `webpack-stream`, used in the gulp file, is out-of-date and uses, I believe, a really old version of webpack.
